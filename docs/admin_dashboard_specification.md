# Admin Dashboard ULKS

# Functional & Technical Specification

This document outlines the complete functional requirements for the "ULKS" e-commerce admin dashboard. This report serves as the final specification for developers, detailing the platform's modules, features, and role-based access control (RBAC). The system is designed with a four-tier user hierarchy: Super Admin, Admin, Store Manager, and Editor. This specification covers every page and component, providing a clear blueprint for development using MongoDB with Prisma ORM.

## 1. User Roles & Permissions Matrix (RBAC)

This matrix is based directly on the provided information and serves as the source of truth for all permissions.
**Hierarchy:** Super Admin (L1) > Admin (L2) > Store Manager (L3) > Editor (L4)

| **Feature/Module** | **Super Admin (L1)** | **Admin (L2)** | **Store Manager (L3)** | **Editor (L4)** |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Dashboard** | Full View | Full View | Sales & Order View | Minimal Stat View |
| **Products** | CRUD | CRUD | CRUD | Update Only (No Price/Delete) |

- **products** - Main product catalog
- **product_images** - Multiple images per product
- **orders** - Order master records

## 3. Global Components

These components are persistent across most pages of the dashboard.
